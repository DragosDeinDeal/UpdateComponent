# UpdatePopupComponent


This component has everything you need in order to show update popups in all of DeinDeal app stack. 

Easily add it as a dependency via SPM or link it to frameworks and libraries section under the
desired target. 

It has two main features: One for showing a force update view that makes the app unusable until 
the user updates via a button that takes him to an AppStore modal and another one for showing a 
custom popup that asks the user if he wants to update to a newer version by taking him to same modal.

Check the sources for full capabilities and more info.

Enjoy !
